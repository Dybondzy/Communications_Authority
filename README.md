# Communications_Authority

1.  Define project
2.  Find types of Spectrums covered in the USA
3.  Find types of Spectrums covered in the Ghana
4.  Present findings


# Project Topic, Background, Audience

## Topic: 
Spectrum Allocation


## Background
I was having a conversation with an old colleague when he mentioned that they had loads of spectrum survey data to go through and didn't know how.  So I volunteered to help sort the data and present the survey results in Tableau.  We decided to start first with a simple project of finding what spectrum is covered internationally (represented by the US) and in Africa (represented by Ghana.)


## Audience
Possible board that decides on giving out Data Analysis contracts


# Spectrun Applications in the US

1.	Broadcasting

2.	Air band

3.	Marine band

4.	Amateur radio frequencies

5.	Citizens' band and personal radio services

6.	Industrial, scientific, medical

7.	Land mobile bands

8.	Police radio and other public safety services such as fire departments and ambulances

9.	Radio control

10.	Licensed amateur radio operators use portions of the 6-meter band in North America. Industrial remote control of cranes or railway locomotives use assigned frequencies that vary by area.

11.	Radar




### Also:
1.  Bandplan 

2.  Bandstacked 

3.  Cellular frequencies 

4.  DXing 

5.  Frequency allocation 

6.  Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975

7.  North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement

8.  Open spectrum

9.  Orbit spectrum

10. Radio astronomy

11. Radio ยง Communication system

12. Scanner (radio)

13. Two-way radio

14. U-NII

15. Ultra-wideband

16. WARC bands

17. Tremendously low frequency (TLF) (electromagnetic radiation, frequency below 3 Hz) [18]
