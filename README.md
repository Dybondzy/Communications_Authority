# Project Topic, Background, Audience

## Topic: Spectrum

### Spectrum Introduction and Types

1.  Spectrum is the invisible radio frequencies that wireless signals travel over.
2.  Electromagnetic spectrum is the frequency for wireless use.
3.  Portions of electromagnetic sprectrum are grouped in bands depending on their wavelengths.
4.  The wavelength is thedistance over which the wave's shape repeats
5.  The full electromagnetic spectrum ranges from 3Hz (extremely low frequency,) to 300 EHz (gamma rays.)
6.  Wireless communication is from 20KHz to 300GHz.
7.  Radio spectrum is the range of radio frequency that are used for communicating.
8.  Spectrum is the entire range of frequencies, like a radio dial that goes up and down to locate an operating radio station, but expanded to assign to other users like mobile phones, satellite TV, air traffic control, or police radios.
9.  Different bands have different characteristics
10.  For wireless communication, spectrum has the three categories: low, mid, and high band spectrum.
11.  All three bands are needed for a robust 5G network.
12.  In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) oversees the commercial sprectrum allocation.
13.  The FCC collborates with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to oversee the government use of spectrum, international bodies, and congress.
14.  FCC often allocates spectrum for commercial use through a spectrum auction, raising money for the US Treasury
15.  Spectrum can be licensed (for exclusive use by specific providers,) or unlicensed (anyone can use the frequency.)
16.  Both licensed and unlicensed spectrum serve important functions.
17.  Bluetooth devices and Wi-Fi connections rely on unlicensed bands.
18.  Spectrum is a finite resource, but it can be repurposed.
19.  The FCC controls 60% of spectrum and regulations and legistlation can help identify bands that the government reallocate for commercial use.
20.  Spectrum is a highly complex comcept and the core component of wireless communications; the benefits of 5G, smart cities, telemedicine. agricultural advencements, and more effective use.
21.  Spectrum Management manages the use of the radio spectrum in order to minimize interference and ensure radio spectrum is used to its most efficient extent and benefit for the public.
22.  The FCC manages and regulates all domestic non-federal spectrum use.
23.  Efficient use and allocation of spectrum will allow the FCC to respond swiftly, maintain contact, and speedily resolve life-threatening situations. 
24.  Effectively managing spectrum will be vital as the next generation of wireless technology – 5G – and the growing number of wireless devices comes on stream.
25.  Spectrum regulation is to protect frequencies used by critical services by preventing harmful interference; identify opportunities to maximize efficiency; allow new technologies to develop and deploy within flexible frameworks; and, reduce the cost of telecommunication equipment.
26.  The spectrum life cycle approach recognizes the following three stages (i) pre-service; (ii) service provision; and (iii) post-service.
