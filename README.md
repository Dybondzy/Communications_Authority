# Project Topic, Background, Audience

Spectrum Management is the art and science of managing the use of the radio spectrum in order to minimize interference and ensure radio spectrum is used to its most efficient extent and benefit for the public.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manages and regulates all domestic non-federal spectrum use (47 USC 301). Background: Radio Act of 1927. Communications Act of 1934.

Efficient use and allocation of spectrum will allow them to respond swiftly, maintain contact, and speedily resolve life-threatening situations. Effectively managing spectrum will be vital as the next generation of wireless technology – 5G – and the growing number of wireless devices comes on stream.

protect frequencies used by critical services by preventing harmful interference; identify opportunities to maximize efficiency. allow new technologies to develop and deploy within flexible frameworks; and, reduce the cost of telecommunication equipment

Taking the Freyen's (2009) framework forward, in our proposed framework, we incorporate the spectrum life cycle approach (Jain, 2010) that recognizes the following three stages (i) pre-service; (ii) service provision; and (iii) post-service.

The 5G spectrum is a range of radio frequencies in the sub-6 GHz range and the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency range that is 24.25 GHz and above. The 5G spectrum refers to the radio frequencies that carry data from user equipment (UE) to cellular base stations to the data's endpoint

SACFA is the decision-making authority for allocation of spectrum frequency. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI): Makes recommendations to the DoT while the DoT has the actual authority to issue licences. TRAI makes recommendations on spectrum allocation and pricing.
