## Topic: Spectrum

### Spectrum Introduction and Types

1.  Spectrum is the invisible radio frequencies that wireless signals travel over.
2.  Electromagnetic spectrum is the frequency for wireless use.
3.  Portions of electromagnetic sprectrum are grouped in bands depending on their wavelengths.
4.  The wavelength is thedistance over which the wave's shape repeats
5.  The full electromagnetic spectrum ranges from 3Hz (extremely low frequency,) to 300 EHz (gamma rays.)
6.  Wireless communication is from 20KHz to 300GHz.
7.  Radio spectrum is the range of radio frequency that are used for communicating.
8.  Spectrum is the entire range of frequencies, like a radio dial that goes up and down to locate an operating radio station, but expanded to assign to other users like mobile phones, satellite TV, air traffic control, or police radios.
9.  Different bands have different characteristics
10.  For wireless communication, spectrum has the three categories: low, mid, and high band spectrum.
11.  All three bands are needed for a robust 5G network.
12.  In the US, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) oversees the commercial sprectrum allocation.
13.  The FCC collborates with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to oversee the government use of spectrum, international bodies, and congress.
14.  FCC often allocates spectrum for commercial use through a spectrum auction, raising money for the US Treasury
15.  Spectrum can be licensed (for exclusive use by specific providers,) or unlicensed (anyone can use the frequency.)
16.  Both licensed and unlicensed spectrum serve important functions.
17.  Bluetooth devices and Wi-Fi connections rely on unlicensed bands.
18.  Spectrum is a finite resource, but it can be repurposed.
19.  The FCC controls 60% of spectrum and regulations and legistlation can help identify bands that the government reallocate for commercial use.
20.  Spectrum is a highly complex comcept and the core component of wireless communications; the benefits of 5G, smart cities, telemedicine. agricultural advencements, and more effective use.
21.  Spectrum Management manages the use of the radio spectrum in order to minimize interference and ensure radio spectrum is used to its most efficient extent and benefit for the public.
22.  The FCC manages and regulates all domestic non-federal spectrum use.
23.  Efficient use and allocation of spectrum will allow the FCC to respond swiftly, maintain contact, and speedily resolve life-threatening situations. 
24.  Effectively managing spectrum will be vital as the next generation of wireless technology – 5G – and the growing number of wireless devices comes on stream.
25.  Spectrum regulation is to protect frequencies used by critical services by preventing harmful interference; identify opportunities to maximize efficiency; allow new technologies to develop and deploy within flexible frameworks; and, reduce the cost of telecommunication equipment.
26.  The spectrum life cycle approach recognizes the following three stages (i) pre-service; (ii) service provision; and (iii) post-service.


## List of Spectrum Frequencies
A radio band is a small contiguous section of the radio spectrum frequencies, in which channels are usually used or set aside for the same purpose. To prevent interference and allow for efficient use of the radio spectrum, similar services are allocated in bands. For example, broadcasting, mobile radio, or navigation devices, will be allocated in non-overlapping ranges of frequencies.

### Bands
1	ITU
2	IEEE radar bands
3	EU, NATO, US ECM frequency designations
4	Waveguide frequency bands
5	Comparison of radio band designation standards


### Applications

#### Broadcasting
Designations for television and FM radio broadcast frequencies vary between countries, see Television channel frequencies and FM broadcast band. Since VHF and UHF frequencies are desirable for many uses in urban areas, in North America some parts of the former television broadcasting band have been reassigned to cellular phone and various land mobile communications systems. Even within the allocation still dedicated to television, TV-band devices use channels without local broadcasters.


#### Air band
Airband refers to VHF frequencies 118 to 137 MHz, used for navigation and voice communication with aircraft. Trans-oceanic aircraft also carry HF radio and satellite transceivers.


#### Marine band
The greatest incentive for development of radio was the need to communicate with ships out of visual range of shore. From the very early days of radio, large oceangoing vessels carried powerful long-wave and medium-wave transmitters. High-frequency allocations are still designated for ships, although satellite systems have taken over some of the safety applications previously served by 500 kHz and other frequencies. 2182 kHz is a medium-wave frequency still used for marine emergency communication.


#### Amateur radio frequencies
Amateur radio frequency allocations vary around the world. Several bands are common for amateurs worldwide, usually in the HF part of the spectrum. Other bands are national or regional allocations only due to differing allocations for other services, especially in the VHF and UHF parts of the radio spectrum.


#### Citizens' band and personal radio services
Citizens' band radio is allocated in many countries, using channelized radios in the upper HF part of the spectrum (around 27 MHz). It is used for personal, small business and hobby purposes. Other frequency allocations are used for similar services in different jurisdictions, for example UHF CB is allocated in Australia. A wide range of personal radio services exist around the world, usually emphasizing short-range communication between individuals or for small businesses, simplified license requirements or in some countries covered by a class license, and usually FM transceivers using around 1 watt or less.


#### Industrial, scientific, medical
The ISM bands were initially reserved for non-communications uses of RF energy, such as microwave ovens, radio-frequency heating, and similar purposes. However, in recent years the largest use of these bands has been by short-range low-power communications systems, since users do not have to hold a radio operator's license. Cordless telephones, wireless computer networks, Bluetooth devices, and garage door openers all use the ISM bands. ISM devices do not have regulatory protection against interference from other users of the band.


#### Land mobile bands
Bands of frequencies, especially in the VHF and UHF parts of the spectrum, are allocated for communication between fixed base stations and land mobile vehicle-mounted or portable transceivers. In the United States these services are informally known as business band radio. See also Professional mobile radio.

Police radio and other public safety services such as fire departments and ambulances are generally found in the VHF and UHF parts of the spectrum. Trunking systems are often used to make most efficient use of the limited number of frequencies available.


#### Radio control
Reliable radio control uses bands dedicated to the purpose. Radio-controlled toys may use portions of unlicensed spectrum in the 27 MHz or 49 MHz bands, but more costly aircraft, boat, or land vehicle models use dedicated radio control frequencies near 72 MHz to avoid interference by unlicensed uses. The 21st century has seen a move to 2.4 GHz spread spectrum RC control systems.

Licensed amateur radio operators use portions of the 6-meter band in North America. Industrial remote control of cranes or railway locomotives use assigned frequencies that vary by area.


#### Radar
Radar applications use relatively high power pulse transmitters and sensitive receivers, so radar is operated on bands not used for other purposes. Most radar bands are in the microwave part of the spectrum, although certain important applications for meteorology make use of powerful transmitters in the UHF band.




### Also:
1.  Bandplan 
(A frequency plan, bandplan, band plan or wavelength plan is a plan for using a particular band of radio frequencies, that are a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Each frequency plan defines the frequency range to be included, how channels are to be defined, and what will be carried on those channels.)
2.  Bandstacked 
(The term bandstacked applies to an antenna or satellite feedhorn (LNBF) that is designed to operate on two or more bands of frequencies. Usually, a portion of the radio frequency spectrum that has been divided into a low band and a high band)
3.  Cellular frequencies 
(Cellular frequencies are the sets of frequency ranges within the ultra high frequency band that have been assigned for cellular-compatible mobile devices, such as mobile phones, to connect to cellular networks.)
4.  DXing 
(DXing is the hobby of receiving and identifying distant radio or television signals, or making two-way radio contact with distant stations in amateur radio, citizens' band radio or other two-way radio communications)
5.  Frequency allocation 
(Frequency allocation (or spectrum allocation or spectrum management) is the allocation and regulation of the electromagnetic spectrum into radio frequency bands, normally done by governments in most countries)
6.  Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975
(The Geneva Frequency Plan of 1975 (Aka "The Final Acts of the Regional Administrative LF/MF Broadcasting Conference (Regions 1 and 3) Geneva, 1975" or simply "GE75") is the internationally agreed frequency plan which was drawn up to implement the provisions of the Final Acts of the Regional Administrative LF/MF Broadcasting Conference (Regions 1 and 3) held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1975. It covers radio broadcasting in the long and medium wave bands outside the Americas (separate agreements being in place for North and South America).)
7.  North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement
(The North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA, Spanish: Convenio Regional Norteamericano de Radiodifusión) refers to a series of international treaties that defined technical standards for AM band (mediumwave) radio stations)
8.  Open spectrum
(Open spectrum (also known as free spectrum) is a movement to get the Federal Communications Commission to provide more unlicensed radio-frequency spectrum that is available for use by all)
9.  Orbit spectrum
(Orbit spectrum, also known as satellite spectrum, is a segment of a radio spectrum that became available when satellites are placed into orbit. This spectrum is a limited resource for every country. In order to ensure optimum utilization of orbit spectrum, the national administrations of countries worldwide undertake regular monitoring exercises. This orbit spectrum is used by service providers to implement satellite broadcasting, communication satellite, and weather satellite services. To ensure quality of services, this orbit spectrum must be used by service providers according to the terms and conditions approved by the respective government. Regulatory measures must be enforced)
10. Radio astronomy
(Radio astronomy is a subfield of astronomy that studies celestial objects at radio frequencies. The first detection of radio waves from an astronomical object was in 1933, when Karl Jansky at Bell Telephone Laboratories reported radiation coming from the Milky Way. Subsequent observations have identified a number of different sources of radio emission. These include stars and galaxies, as well as entirely new classes of objects, such as radio galaxies, quasars, pulsars, and masers. The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation, regarded as evidence for the Big Bang theory, was made through radio astronomy)
11. Radio § Communication system
(Radio is the technology of signaling and communicating using radio waves.[1][2][3] Radio waves are electromagnetic waves of frequency between 30 hertz (Hz) and 300 gigahertz (GHz). They are generated by an electronic device called a transmitter connected to an antenna which radiates the waves, and received by another antenna connected to a radio receiver. Radio is very widely used in modern technology, in radio communication, radar, radio navigation, remote control, remote sensing, and other applications)
12. Scanner (radio)
(A scanner (also referred to as a radio scanner) is a radio receiver that can automatically tune, or scan, two or more discrete frequencies, stopping when it finds a signal on one of them and then continuing to scan other frequencies when the initial transmission ceases)
13. Two-way radio
(A two-way radio is a radio that can both transmit and receive radio waves (a transceiver), unlike a broadcast receiver which only receives content. It is an audio (sound) transceiver, a transmitter and receiver in one unit, used for bidirectional person-to-person voice communication with other users with similar radios. Two-way radios are available in stationary (base station), mobile (installed in vehicles), and hand-held portable models. Hand-held two-way radios are often called walkie-talkies, handie-talkies or hand-helds. Two-way radios are used by groups of geographically separated people who need to keep in continuous voice communication, such as aircraft pilots and air traffic controllers, ship captains and harbormasters, emergency services personnel like firefighters, police officers, and ambulance paramedics, taxi and delivery services, soldiers and military units, fast food and warehouse employees, and radio amateurs)
14. U-NII
(The Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (U-NII)[1][2] radio band, as defined by the United States Federal Communications Commission, is part of the radio frequency spectrum used by WLAN devices and by many wireless ISPs)
15. Ultra-wideband
(Ultra-wideband (UWB, ultra wideband, ultra-wide band and ultraband) is a radio technology that can use a very low energy level for short-range, high-bandwidth communications over a large portion of the radio spectrum.[1] UWB has traditional applications in non-cooperative radar imaging. Most recent applications target sensor data collection, precision locating[2] and tracking applications.[3][4] UWB support started to appear in high-end smartphones)
16. WARC bands
(The World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) bands are three portions of the shortwave radio spectrum used by licensed and/or certified amateur radio operators. They consist of 30 meters (10.100–10.150 MHz), 17 meters (18.068–18.168 MHz) and 12 meters (24.890–24.990 MHz).[1][2] They were named after the World Administrative Radio Conference, which in 1979 created a worldwide allocation of these bands for amateur use. The bands were opened for use in the early 1980s. Due to their relatively small bandwidth of 100 kHz or less, there is a gentlemen's agreement that the WARC bands may not be used for general contesting)
17. Tremendously low frequency (TLF) (electromagnetic radiation, frequency below 3 Hz) [18]


## Spectrum Allocation in Ghana
The National Communications Authority (NCA) has published the National Frequency Allocation Table (NFAT) for wireless communications services in Ghana.  The NFAT is one of the most important tools for effective spectrum management; It details the uses of the various frequency bands for the numerous radio communication service categories in accordance with the Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

The objective of developing the NFAT is to maximize the efficient use of radio spectrum while assuring that spectrum is made available for new technologies and services. The table contains current uses of spectrum and those that may be used in future.
